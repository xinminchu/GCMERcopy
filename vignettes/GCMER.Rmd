## Graph Coloring Method for Entity Resolution

This R package provides general functions for graph coloring as well as specific functions for entity resolution, aka data deduplication.

```{r fun, echo=FALSE}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
