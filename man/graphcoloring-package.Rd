\title{graphcoloring: Graph Coloring Algorithms for Tidygraph}
\description{
A collection of graph coloring algorithms for coloring vertices of 
    a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The algorithms
    are included via the embedded 'GraphColoring' C++ library, <https://github.com/brrcrites/GraphColoring>.
